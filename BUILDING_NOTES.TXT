Building requires a working PSL1GHT build environment
Compiling requires you to install libz libpng and freetype2 built for PSL1GHT
Please run make in system-l1ght, nestopia, vbam, and gambatte directories before mednafen
If you get a message like 'udefined reference to 'vbamGetVBAM'', cd into the vbam directory and type 'make vbam-objmangle'

When building for sdl specify the folling values in the environment
	PLATFROM: Set to 'sdl'
	SDLCONFIG: The path to the proper sdl-config script
	TARGETPLATFORM: Set to 'windows' when building for windows

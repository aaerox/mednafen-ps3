Building requires a working PSL1GHT build environment
Compiling requires you to install libz libpng and freetype2 built for PSL1GHT
Please run make in system-l1ght, nestopia, vbam, and gambatte directories before mednafen
If you get a message like 'udefined reference to 'vbamGetVBAM'', cd into the vbam directory and type 'make vbam-objmangle'

Environment varibles for controlling build:
	PLATFORM: Set to 'l1ght' for PS3 or 'sdl' for SDL. If not set it defaults to l1ght
	PSL1GHT: Set to the base directory of you psl1ght install
	FREETYPECONFIG: Set to the path to the proper 'freetype-config' script.
	SDLCONFIG: Set to the path to the proper 'sdl-config' script
	TARGETPLATFORM: Set to 'windows' when building SDL for windows
	PREFIX: Set the prefix for gcc binaries, defaults to 'ppu-' for l1ght and none for SDL

 <a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
 <p>
 This main document covers general Mednafen usage, regardless of which system is being emulated.  Documentation covering key assignments, settings, and related information for each system emulation module is linked to in the table of contents under "Emulation Module Documentation".
 </p>
 <p>
 In several places references are made to the "base directory".  If you
 are running a port on a UN*X-like system(Linux/*BSD/Mac OSX/SunOS/etc.), the
 base directory is "~/.mednafen", or in other words, 
 "your home directory plus .mednafen".  For all other ports(including DOS and
MS Windows), the base directory is the directory that the executable is in.
 </p>
 <p>
 Mednafen includes parts of or links with the following software packages and programs, so give the developers lots of thanks sometime(<b>NOTE</b> they do not provide user support for Mednafen,

 <a name="features-ips"><h3>Automatic IPS Patching</h3></a>
 <p>
        Place the IPS file in the same directory as the file to load,
        and name it filename.ips.
</p>
	<pre>
        Examples:       Boat.nes - Boat.nes.ips
                        Boat.zip - Boat.zip.ips
                        Boat.nes.gz - Boat.nes.gz.ips
                        Boat     - Boat.ips
        </pre>
	<p>
        Some operating systems and environments will hide file extensions.
        Keep this in mind if you are having trouble.
	</p>
	<p>
        Patching is supported for all supported formats, but it will probably only be useful
	for fixed-position file formats.
 </p>
 <a name="features-cdrom"><h3>CD-ROM Emulation</h3></a>
 <p>
  With PC Engine CD and PC-FX emulation, Mednafen can load CD-ROM games from a physical CD-ROM, or a ripped/dumped copy of the disc, such as CUE+BIN.
  Using a ripped copy of the disc is recommended, due to speed issues and to the fact that physical CDs will be missing pregaps from the point
  of view of the emulated system.
 </p>
 <p>
  For ripped disc images, Mednafen supports "CUE" sheets and cdrdao "TOC" files.  Mednafen supports raw, simple storage formats supported by
  libsndfile(MS WAV, AIFF/AIFC, AU/SND, etc.), Ogg Vorbis, and MusePack audio files referenced by CUE sheets.  MP3 is not supported, and will not be 
  supported.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cdrdao "TOC" support in Mednafen includes support for "RW_RAW" subchannel data, needed for CD+G.  Note that Mednafen assumes that the Q subchannel
  is also included in the RW_RAW data area in the ripped image(even though the name "RW_RAW" would suggest it isn't present, cdrdao seems to included it).  If
  the Q subchannel data is missing from the RW_RAW data area in the ripped image, Mednafen's CD emulation will not work properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since 0.8.4, Mednafen will perform simple data correction on ripped CDROM images that contain EDC and L-EC data(2352-byte-per-sector "raw" rips").
  It calculates the real EDC, and if it doesn't match the EDC recorded for that sector, it will evaluate the L-EC data to repair the data.  If the
  data is unrepairable, an error message will be displayed.
  <br>
  <b>This may cause problems with naive patches that don't update the error-correction data(at least the 32-bit EDC, if that's correct, the L-EC data will
  be ignored)!</b>  If you wish to use such an invalid patch, set the setting "cdrom.lec_eval" to 0.

 <a name="using-cli"><h3>Command-line</h3></a>
 <p>
  Mednafen supports arguments passed on the command line.   Arguments
  are taken in the form of "-parameter value".  Some arguments are valueless.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the arguments listed in the table below, any setting listed in the "Settings" section of this document and any system emulation module sub-document can be set by prefixing it with
  a hyphen(-), followed by the parameter, such as: -nes.slstart 8
</p>
  <table border>
   <tr><th>Argument:</th><th>Parameter Type:</th><th>Description:</th></tr>
   <tr><td>-loadcd x</td><td>string</td><td>Load and boot a CD for system "x"(only "pce" is valid).  This argument modifies the usage of the filename component of the command-line.  For example, "mednafen -loadcd pce /somewhere/over/the/rainbow/game.cue" will load the CUE sheet as the emulated CDROM.
"mednafen -loadcd pce" will load from the default physical CDROM device. </td></tr>
   <tr><td>-connect</td><td></td><td>Trigger to connect to remote host after the game is loaded.</td></tr>
  </table>
<hr>
<a name="using-settings"><h3>Settings</h3></a>
  <p>
  <b>Caution:</b> Any settings that change emulation behavior as seen from the emulated game are shown with bold text in the table.  One should be
  conscious of these settings if one has changed them from the default values when using network play or movies, as
  they can cause desychronizations if not set the same among hosts(or between the recording emulator and the
  playing emulator).
  </p>

  <p>
  Settings listed in this table that contain &lt;system&gt; should have that string replaced with an emulation module name("nes", "pce", "pcfx", etc.).<br>Example: <b>&lt;system&gt;.xscale</b> becomes <b>nes.xscale</b>.

<ul>
<li>alsa

<a href="http://alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a><br>A recommended driver, and the default for Linux(if available).</blockquote></hr>
</blockquote>
<hr>
</li>
<li>oss
<blockquote>
<a href="http://">Open Sound System</a><br>A recommended driver, and the default for non-Linux UN*X/POSIX/BSD systems, or anywhere ALSA is unavailable.  If the ALSA driver gives you problems, you can try using this one instead.
<p>
If you are using OSSv4 or newer, you should edit "/usr/lib/oss/conf/osscore.conf", uncomment the max_intrate= line, and change the value from 100(default) to 1000(or higher if you know what you're doing), and restart OSS.  Otherwise, performance will be poor, and the sound buffer size in Mednafen will be orders of magnitude larger than specified.
</p>
<p>
If the sound buffer size is still excessively larger than what is specified via the "soundbufsize" setting, you can try setting "sound.period_time" to 2666, and as a last resort, 5333, to work around a design flaw/limitation/choice in the OSS API and OSS implementation.

<a name="using-firmware"><h3>Firmware/BIOS</h3></a>
<p>
Some emulation modules require firmware/BIOS images to function.  If a firmware path is non-absolute(doesn't begin with
C:\ or / or similar), Mednafen will try to load the file relative to the "firmware" directory under the Mednafen base
directory.  If it doesn't find it there, it will be loaded relative to the Mednafen base directory itself.  Of course,
if the "path_firmware" setting is set to a custom value, the firmware files will be searched relative to that path.
